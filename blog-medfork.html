                    Problems in existing EHR system:
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interoperability: It is the way for different information systems to
                        exchange information between them.
                    </li>
                    <li>Information Asymmetry: which refers to one party having better access
                        to information than the other party.
                    </li>
                    <li>Data Breaches: Data breaches in healthcare sector also calls for the
                        need of a better platform.

                <h2 class="solution"> Solution</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We present a technique where we’ve leveraged the blockchain
                        technology to transform the EHR systems and could be a solution for
                        the above issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The aim of our solution is firstly to implement blockchain technology
                        for EHR and to give back the control of the Medical data to the
                        patients. Moreover, we’ve also presented a solution for the scalability
                        problem faced by the blockchain using off-chain decentralized
                        storage for storing the EHR data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another main issue in the traditional framework is, our EHR data is
                        accessed and shared with unauthorized Personnel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hence, we have designed a framework for sharing of EHR which is
                        solely controlled by the patient to whom the EHR data belongs to
                        and in order to keep the track of old EHR’s we are going to
                        implement git like, version control system on top of the IPFS.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Data in our system can only be accessed by the patient’s private key,
                        even if someone obtains data from the decentralized storage, data
                        will be unreadable and patients have full control over accessing their
                        healthcare data, patients will control who sees their data and what
                        they see. Hence, there’s a reduced risk of errors, and better patient
                        care. We believe, that the above solution will definitely improve our
                        current Healthcare industry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We have ensured decentralization in every flow of the system. Hence,
                        there is no single point of failure.
